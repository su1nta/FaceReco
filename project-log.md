## Other work 
- [Reference to already created project | facerec_from_webcam_faster.py](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/facerec_from_webcam_faster.py) [Not very much have been done, **under work**]
- **Figuring out about the face recognition models** [*Not any resource is found yet*]

# Purpose of creating this log
*Not much work has been done, low on time. So keeping a track will give a sense of urgency.*
---
*Rate of work being done will help figuring out strategy*
