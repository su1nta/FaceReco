# Tutorial to create virtual enviornments in python
<br />

### Virtual enviornments are required when working on  a big project, to make sure **all dependencies are always satisfied**.

<br />

<p>The following is the <strong><em>python</em></strong> command to create a virtual enviornment :<p>
<br/>

```
    python -m venv <name>
```

<br/>

<p>Note that, just creating the venv is not everything, virtual enviornment needs to be activated first. Below is the command to activate a venv :</p>

```
    source <name of venv/bin/activate>
```

<br/>

## Windows (using powershell)
