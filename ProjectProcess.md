- Python functions are first class objects and can be assigned to another object/variable
    - for example there is a following code: 
    ```
    # here get_frontal_face_detector is a function which reference is passed to the object detector. Now detector is a function object which is like a pointer to
    # the function get_frontal_face_detector()
    detector = dlib.get_frontal_face_detector()
    ```
